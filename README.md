# cnotes

cnotes is a command line, "repl" style notes/todo application written in C. It aims for a small codebase, portability and simple usage.

## Features:
* BSD license, do whatever you want
* Small codebase
* Fast
* No external dependencies beyond libc and a C compiler (I use clang, should work with gcc/tcc/the rest)
* "Bring your own editor" - cnotes accepts just about any text editor as a compile time constant
* Tiny, compiles almost instantly
