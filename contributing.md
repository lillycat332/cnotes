# Contributing to cnotes
I aim to make cnotes simple to contribute to, without any stringent restrictions on developers.
* First of all, please DO NOT suggest me to rewrite this in rust/whatever flavour-of-the-month language.
* Please use descriptive names for issues and PRs.
* Attach things like coredumps and screenshots to your issues if helpful.
* Contributions ideally should follow the style guidelines.
* Don't open issues unnecessarily, anything that isn't actually an issue should be asked in Discussions.
